# Long Read Club

Long read club is part of a recently funded Wellcome Trust Technology Development Award. Our overall goal is to help the genomics community achieve finished quality, complete reference quality genomes routinely and at scale.

## Email list

The first rule of long read club is ... <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1T4T3GsMMcuREW-DFb1h5XoBB-Wdj00DxmyseZka1zhc/viewform">sign-up for email notifications to be informed about upcoming online events!</a>. We're also hiring post-docs and technicians, so please get in touch with <a href="mailto:n.j.loman@bham.ac.uk">Nick</a> or <a href="mailto:matt.loose@nottingham.ac.uk">Matt</a> if you are interested.

## Datasets

This page contains links to examplar or notable long-read datasets:

### Nanopore NA12878 Consortium

The nanopore human WGS consortium are curating a regularly-updated NA12878 human cell line
data release from nanopore data. More information on their Github:

<https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/NA12878>

### Telomere-to-telomere Consortium

![Telomere to telomere consortium logo](assets/t2t.png)

At AGBT 2019, the T2T consortium released an extensive dataset for the haploid human CHM13 cell
line including 50X ultra-long nanopore coverage, 10X Genomics data, BioNano data. This is
complimented by existing PacBio data. The goal of the consortium is to complete a telomere-to-telomere
contiguous finished assembly of a haploid human genome.

Find out more at their website: <https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup/home>
Data release available via GitHub: <https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/CHM13>

### E. coli ultra-long read dataset

As part of protocol development, we have generated extensive ultra-long read data for 
E. coli K-12 MG1655 which is released here in case it is useful for development (e.g.
of assembly software).
